## My Perspective

My area of interest is 'Social Cognition' or how we think about the
social world around us, perceive ourselves and those around us as social
agents, and deploy interpersonal behaviours within our environment.

I subscribe to the 4E Cognitive Science model, specifically that we are
not separate brains in separate jars, but rather

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Embodied

-   Cognition is rooted in the body’s interactions with the world.

### Embedded

-   Cognition is deeply influenced by the environment in which it
    occurs.

### Enacted

-   Cognition emerges through action and dynamic interaction with the
    environment.

### Extended

-   Cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain and body to include
    tools and technologies.

## But we will return to that shortly...

. . .

As a deception researcher, I spend a great deal of time thinking about
'Truth'

# "Data is the new oil"

## A Post-Truth Era?

::: nonincremental
-   **Emotion versus Evidence**
    -   Truth wrestles with feelings and beliefs.
    -   Social media algorithms amplified biases and emotional content.
-   **Fragmentation of Reality**
    -   Echo chambers and "alternative facts" polarise perceptions of
        truth.
:::

## Truthiness: When It Feels True {.nonincremental}

::: nonincremental
-   **Gut Over Fact**
    -   Coined by Stephen Colbert, "truthiness" refers to beliefs that
        "feel" true without factual basis.
    -   Charisma and narrative outweigh evidence.
-   **Superficial Authenticity**
    -   'Truth' becomes a matter of personal resonance, not universal
        agreement.
:::

## Where Are We REALLY Now? {.nonincremental}

::: nonincremental
-   **Hybrid Reality**
    -   The battle between evidence-based truths and emotionally driven
        narratives continues.
    -   Trust in institutions, expertise and 'the old rules' is fragile.
-   **The Path Forward**
    -   Promoting media/data literacy and critical thinking.
    -   Balancing facts with empathy to rebuild shared realities.
:::

# Let's travel back in time... to 1998

## The Information Explosion: The 24-Hour News Cycle

::: nonincremental
-   **Rise of Mass Media**
    -   Late 20th century: Television, cable news, and eventually the
        internet democratized information.
    -   Facts became widely accessible, but so did misinformation.
-   **Information Overload**
    -   Audiences struggled to process and evaluate the growing flood of
        data.
    -   Trust in institutions began to erode under competing narratives.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The term **"Reality Distortion Field" (RDF)** is a phrase to describe
**Steve Jobs'** ability to convince himself and others to believe in
almost anything, even in the face of impossible odds or evidence to the
contrary.

![](images/stevejobs-01.png){fig-align="center"}

The Reality Distortion Field refers to Jobs' combination of **charisma,
passion, persuasion, and vision** that made him an irresistible force,
but somewhat distasteful to the modern eye despite his achievements.

# The Biggest lie ever told

## **The Incident:**

::: nonincremental
-   In January 1998, Bill Clinton, then-President of the United States,
    famously made the 'Clinton Denial'

-   The statement was in response to allegations of an *extramarital
    affair* with Monica Lewinsky, a 22 year-old White House intern.

### **Became widely known as the "Lewinsky Scandal"**

-   **Key Context:**

    -   **Impeachment Risk:** The statement became pivotal in the
        investigation led by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, which
        aimed to uncover misconduct by Clinton.

    -   **Perjury Accusation:** Clinton's denial under oath led to
        accusations of perjury, which formed the basis for his later
        impeachment by the House of Representatives.
:::

## **The Political Climate:**

::: nonincremental
-   **1990s Partisan Divide:** The U.S. political landscape was deeply
    polarized, with Republicans seeking to capitalize on Clinton's
    vulnerabilities.

-   **Moral Conservatism:** The 1990s were marked by a strong focus on
    personal morality in politics, with high public scrutiny of
    politicians' private lives.

-   **Cultural Change:** The rise of 24-hour news cycles and tabloids
    (e.g., *Drudge Report*) amplified scandals and created a media
    frenzy.
:::

## **Impact on Public Opinion:**

::: nonincremental
-   While the scandal shocked many, Clinton's approval ratings remained
    high, as the public often separated his personal behavior from his
    political performance.

-   Many viewed the investigation as excessively partisan, fueling
    debates about privacy and accountability in public office.
:::

## Context and Setting

::: nonincremental
-   Press conference about after-school care
-   Impromptu denial tacked on at end
-   High stakes political environment
-   Media presence and cameras
:::

## The Impact of the 'Clinton Scandal' on Monica Lewinsky {background-color="beige"}

::: nonincremental
1.  **Power Imbalance**:
    -   As a young intern, she was vulnerable to the dynamics of
        authority and trust in the workplace.
2.  **Public Shaming and Media Exploitation**:
    -   Relentless media coverage turned her into a caricature,
        stripping her of dignity and agency.
    -   Misogyny amplified the scrutiny, with her bearing the brunt of
        societal blame.
:::

::: nonincremental
3.  **Societal Judgment and Stigma**:
    -   She became a symbol of scandal, enduring widespread slut-shaming
        and societal alienation.
    -   Her name was unfairly reduced to a single event, erasing her
        complexity as a person.
4.  **Psychological and Emotional Impact**:
    -   The betrayal, humiliation, and loss of privacy caused deep
        emotional trauma.
    -   She faced depression and suicidal thoughts as a result of the
        public vilification.
:::

## The Impact of the 'Clinton Scandal' on Monica Lewinsky 3 {background-color="beige"}

::: nonincremental
5.  **Professional Consequences**:
    -   The scandal overshadowed her career prospects, leaving her with
        limited opportunities.
6.  **Legacy and Redemption**:
    -   While initially treated as a cautionary tale, Lewinsky has since
        reclaimed her voice, becoming an advocate for anti-bullying and
        reflecting on the harm of public shaming.
:::

## Monica Lewinsky’s Perspective on the Clinton Affair {background-color="beige"}

::: nonincremental
1.  **Personal Regret and Accountability**
    -   Lewinsky has expressed regret for her involvement, recognizing
        her actions as influenced by youthful infatuation and emotional
        needs.
2.  **Power Imbalance and Consent**
    -   Over time, she has come to see the relationship through the lens
        of power dynamics, acknowledging the impact of Clinton’s
        authority and her vulnerability.
:::

## Monica Lewinsky’s Perspective on the Clinton Affair 2 {background-color="beige"}

::: nonincremental
3.  **Public Shaming and Cyberbullying**
    -   As one of the earliest victims of global public shaming,
        Lewinsky has highlighted the intense scrutiny she faced and its
        effects on her mental health, leading her to advocate against
        cyberbullying.
4.  **Societal Hypocrisy and Double Standards**
    -   Lewinsky critiques the double standards, noting the harsher
        judgment she faced compared to Clinton and how society often
        disproportionately blames women in cases of moral impropriety.
:::

::: nonincremental
5.  **Reclaiming Her Narrative**
    -   Through writing, speaking, and advocacy, Lewinsky has worked to
        reclaim her story, focusing on resilience and empowering others
        to overcome public shaming.

## The Biggest Lie Ever Told

**Global Scale and Media Coverage**

-   The lie reached millions globally, with real-time media coverage and
    international scrutiny.

**Breach of Public Trust**

-   Clinton’s lie as a head of state under oath broke public trust,
    fostering widespread cynicism toward political leaders.

**Legal Repercussions and Impeachment**

-   Clinton’s denial led to charges of perjury and impeachment, a rare
    and profound consequence.

## The Biggest Lie Ever Told

**Psychological and Cultural Impact**

-   The scandal prompted debates on public and private morality,
    influencing society’s view on honesty in leadership.

**Iconic Language and Lasting Legacy**

-   The phrasing became iconic, making it a memorable cultural
    phenomenon and embedding it in public consciousness.

## The impact on Deception Research

The 'Clinton Denial' became the Prototype of high-stakes deception.

At the time, media pored over every frame, but the science and the
technology was basic

Later 'ground-truth' was established. The Blue Gap Cocktail Dress and an
admission.

The Clinton Denial became the 'Touchstone' for deception detection and
case study.

## The consequences of 9/11

There was a noticeable increase in funding for anti-deception research
in the aftermath of 9/11

To say this was 'frenzied' may seem like
exaggeration![](images/Everybodylies.jpg){width="500"}![](images/Lietome.jpg){width="417"}

## Illustrative Interpretation:

Clinton's denial can be "read" as a crafted narrative intended to manage
his political survival, balancing legal precision with an attempt to
appear sincere.

The audience's interpretation depends on the interplay between the
words, the delivery, and the cultural expectations of honesty.

## Deception overview

-   Deception is complex and multifaceted
-   Traditional focus on stereotypical nonverbal behaviour is
    ineffective
-   No single 'Pinocchio's Nose' exists
-   Need for **multimodal** analysis approach and embracing of
    contextual complexity

# The Clinton Lie: Multimodal Signals

## 1. Linguistic Dynamics

-   Shift from policy language to defensive language
-   Use of definitive phrases ("I did not have...")
-   Distancing language ("that woman")
-   Pronoun emphasis ("I never told anybody...")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you very much.\
First, let me thank all of you who are here.\
Many of us have been working together now for 20 years on a lot of these
issues, and this is a very happy day for us.

I thank the First Lady for all she has done on this issue for as long as
I have known her.\
I thank the Vice President and Mrs. Gore for their family conference and
the light it has shed on the announcement we're here to emphasize
today.\
Thank you, Secretary Riley, for the community learning centers, and I'm
very proud of what we've done there.

Thank you, Bill White.\
I'll talk more about your contribution in a moment, but it is truly
remarkable.\
I thank Rand and Debra Bass for giving us a living, breathing example of
the best of America: parents who are working hard to do their jobs but
also determined to do their most important job very well with their
children.\
I thank Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, and Senator Boxer for being
here.

Tomorrow, in the State of the Union Address, I will spell out what we
seek to do on behalf of our children to prepare them for the 21st
century.\
But I want to talk a little bit about education today and about this
announcement in that context.

Education must be our Nation's highest priority.\
Last year, in the State of the Union Address, I set out a 10-point plan
to move us forward and urged the American people to make sure that
politics stops at the schoolhouse door.\
Well, we've made a lot of progress on that 10-point plan: a remarkable
array of initiatives to open the doors of college to every American
who's willing to work for it; strong progress toward high national
standards in the basics, the America Reads challenge to teach every
8-year-old to read; continued progress in the Vice President's program
to hook up all of our classrooms and libraries to the Internet by the
year 2000.

This has been the most important year in a generation for education
reform.\
Tomorrow I'll set out the next steps on our continuing road.

First, I will propose the first-ever national effort to reduce class
size in the early grades.\
Hillary and I worked very hard 15 years ago now to have very strict
class sizes at home in the early grades, and it was quite controversial
and, I think, enormously beneficial when we did it.\
Our balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 teachers who must pass
State competency tests but who will be able to reduce class size in the
first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 nationwide.

Second, since there are more students and there will be more teachers,
there must be more classrooms.\
So I will propose a school construction tax cut to help communities
modernize and build new schools.

Third, I will promote a national effort to help schools that follow the
lead of the Chicago system in ending social promotion but helping
students with summer school and other programs to give them the tools
they need to get ahead.

All these steps will help our children get the future they deserve.\
And that's why what we're announcing here is so important as well.

Every child needs someplace to go after school.\
With after-school programs, we can not only keep our kids healthy and
happy and safe, we can help to teach them to say no to drugs, alcohol,
and crime, yes to reading, sports, and computers.\
My balanced budget plan includes a national initiative to spark private
sector and local community efforts to provide after-school care, as the
Secretary of Education said, to half a million more children.

Now, let me say, in addition to all the positive benefits, I think it's
important to point out that the hours between 3 and 7 at night are the
most vulnerable hours for young people to get in trouble, for juvenile
crime.\
There is this sort of assumption that everybody that gets in trouble
when they're young has just already been abandoned.\
That's not true.\
Most of the kids that get in trouble get in trouble after school closes
and before their parents get home from work.\
So in the adolescent years, in the later years, it is profoundly
important to try to give kids something to say yes to and something
positive to do.

But we can't do it alone.\
As I said, our plan involves a public-private partnership.\
So it has fallen to me to announce that our distinguished guest from the
Mott Foundation of Flint, Michigan, has pledged up to \$55 million to
help ensure that after-school programs supported by Federal funds are of
the highest quality.\
That is an astonishing gift.\
Thank you, Bill White.\
Thank you.

We are determined to help Americans succeed in the workplace, to raise
well-educated, healthy kids, and to help Americans succeed at the
toughest job of all, that of being a parent.\
And the Mott Foundation has gone a long way toward helping us.\
I thank them.

Now, I have to go back to work on my State of the Union speech.\
And I worked on it until pretty late last night.\
But I want to say one thing to the American people.\
I want you to listen to me.\
I'm going to say this again.\
[**I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.**]{style="color:red;"}\
I never told anybody to lie, not a single time—never.\
These allegations are false.\
And I need to go back to work for the American people.

Thank you.

## Facial Action Coding System

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system to taxonimize human
facial movements based upon their underlying musculature.

It was first developed by Carl-Herman Hjortsö in 1978 and then
popularised and expanded upon by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in
2002.

-   Aggressive finger pointing (uncharacteristic gesture)
-   Fixed gaze and eye-widening during denial
-   Postural changes from policy speech to denial
-   Breaking from his usual gestural patterns

## 3. Acoustic Changes

-   Fundamental frequency shifts
-   Changes in speech rhythm
-   Doubled rate of pitch peaks during denial
-   Distinct from baseline speaking pattern

## Dunbar's Number

![](images/Dunbar.png){fig-align="center"}

## **The Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis**

The Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis posits that social demands
have driven the evolution of the cognitive facilities humans employ to
navigate their social domain.

‘Machiavellian’ strategies, such as deception, interpersonal
manipulation, cooperation, and alliance formation allow individuals to
achieve higher social and reproductive success.

# Machiavellian Traits

-   Strategic manipulation of appearances
-   Skilled management of power dynamics
-   Control over social narratives
-   Calculated use of context
-   Mastery of asymmetrical relationships

## But what about 'normal' humans? {background-color="#ef3a5d"}

## Types of Lies and Their Frequency

-   **Personal Transgression (22%)**: Cover up a mistake or misdeed.
-   **Economic Advantage (16%)**: Gain financial benefits through
    dishonesty.
-   **Personal Advantage (15%)**: Secure benefits that are not
    necessarily financial.
-   **Avoidance (14%)**: Escape or evade interactions with other people.
-   **Self-Impression (8%)**: Shape a positive image of oneself.
-   **Humor (5%)**: Make people laugh, often using exaggerated or
    fictitious elements.
-   **Social or Polite (5%)**: Uphold social roles or avoid rudeness.
-   **Altruistic (4%)**: Help someone else by telling a lie.
-   **Malicious (2%)**: Intentionally hurt others through deception.
-   **Pathological (2%)**: Disregard for reality; habitual lying without
    clear reason.
-   **Unknown (7%)**: Motives are unclear, even to ourselves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Do We Lie?

-   **To Protect Yourself**: Many lies are told to avoid negative
    outcomes for oneself, whether to evade blame or cover up a mistake.
-   **To Promote Yourself**: Lies often serve as a means to advance
    one's interests, whether for economic or personal benefit.
-   **To Impact Others**: Lies can also be intended to influence,
    entertain, or help others, from humor to altruistic deception.

## A new type of lie

What about considering the 'Future-Truth' - it's a lie right now, but by
the time anyone finds out, it will be the truth.

To what degree is this a normal aspect of self-presentation and
'growth'?

## Bill Clinton as the Prototype Machiavellian

-   **Masterful Charm and Charisma**
    -   Clinton's charm helped him connect deeply with others, using it
        as a tool for influence—a core Machiavellian trait.
-   **Strategic Adaptability**
    -   He showed flexibility in adapting to scandals and challenges,
        focusing on maintaining control and favorable outcomes.

## Bill Clinton as the Prototype Machiavellian 2

-   **Calculated Risk-Taking**
    -   Clinton took high-stakes risks, characteristic of
        Machiavellians, who weigh costs and benefits to achieve personal
        success.
-   **Political Manipulation and Persuasion**
    -   Known for “Clintonian triangulation,” he skillfully built
        alliances, navigated power dynamics, and appealed to both sides.

## Bill Clinton as the Prototype Machiavellian 3

-   **Instrumental Rationality**
    -   His pragmatic approach prioritized effective outcomes over
        ethical consistency, focusing on what was politically
        advantageous.
-   **Effective Management of Public Image**
    -   Clinton maintained a favorable public image despite
        controversies, displaying expert self-presentation skills.
-   **Boundary Between Public and Private Morality**
    -   Demonstrating psychological compartmentalization, he separated
        personal actions from his public role, a typical Machiavellian
        characteristic.

# Machiavellianism in Action:

## Clinton Through the FFMI Lens

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Five Factor Machiavellian Inventory Dimensions

**Antagonism** - Represents traits associated with hostility,
selfishness, and disregard for others. It includes behaviors like
manipulation, callousness, immodesty, and cynicism. Antagonistic
individuals prioritize their own needs and goals, often at the expense
of others, and may lack empathy or compassion.

**Agency** - Refers to traits related to ambition, self-confidence, and
assertiveness. High agency reflects a strong sense of competence,
goal-directed behavior, and the ability to influence and lead. People
with high agency are self-assured, persistent, and less prone to
self-doubt.

**Planfulness** - Involves strategic thinking, organization, and
deliberation. Planful individuals are methodical, prefer structure, and
think through decisions before acting. Low planfulness, on the other
hand, reflects impulsivity, spontaneity, and a lack of foresight or
organization.
