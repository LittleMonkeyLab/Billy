Antagonistic individuals prioritize their own needs and goals, often at the expense of others, and may lack empathy or compassion.\nAgency - Refers to traits related to ambition, self-confidence, and assertiveness. High agency reflects a strong sense of competence, goal-directed behavior, and the ability to influence and lead. People with high agency are self-assured, persistent, and less prone to self-doubt.\nPlanfulness - Involves strategic thinking, organization, and deliberation. Planful individuals are methodical, prefer structure, and think through decisions before acting. Low planfulness, on the other hand, reflects impulsivity, spontaneity, and a lack of foresight or organization."
